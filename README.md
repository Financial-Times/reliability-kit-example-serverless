# Reliability Kit: Serverless Example

This is an example [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) application which illustrates how to use [FT.com Reliability Kit](https://github.com/Financial-Times/dotcom-reliability-kit#readme).

All of the code for this example app is in [`index.js`](./index.js) and [`serverless.yml`](./serverless.yml).

> **Warning**
> It's important to remember that this app isn't an example of how to correctly set up a Financial Times Serverless application â€“ it's used to illustrate how to integrate Reliability Kit with as little boilerplate code as possible.

```
